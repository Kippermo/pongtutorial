        	<h1> Step 1: Creating a Canvas </h1>
		<p>
                        First things first, we need a place to play! Javascript has a special object called a canvas, which is exactly what it sounds like: a canvas is a rectangular place on which you can draw things on a webpage. 
                </p>

		<div class = "codediv">
			<p>
				var canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
				</br>
				var ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
				</br>
                		function draw() {
				</br>
                        		ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
                		</br>
				}
				</br>
                		setInterval(draw, 10);
			</p>
		</div>

		</br>

		</br>

		</br>

		</br>

		</br>

		</br>

		<p>
			<p>The first two lines in this block of code are somewhat confusing, so I'll break it down for you.</p>
			
			
			<p>The first line gets the canvas object (which is created in the html) and sets it equal to a variable called canvas.</p>


			<p>The next line takes that canvas's context and puts it into a variable called ctx. This context is the way that we will be able to draw to this canvas.</p> 
		</p>

		<p>
			<p>The next portion is very crucial. In line 3, we define a function called draw.


			<p>Draw is a special function that is called whenever a javascript file is run.</p>


			<p>Outside of the draw function, we set the draw interval to 10, meaning that it will execute whatever is contained in the draw function every ten miliseconds.</p>


			<p>As you will soon see, this repeated drawing allows for us to create animation and movement.</p>


			<p>So far, the only thing that we are drawing is a clear rectangle. The rectangle starts at the point (0, 0) on the canvas (the upper left-hand corner) and has a width and height equal to that of the canvas. In other words, we are simply drawing a rectangle to cover the entire canvas.</p>


			<p>This code should simply create a large, white rectangle on your screen.</p>  
		</p>

	<canvas id = "myCanvas" width = "600" height = "300" style = border: 1px solid #d3d3d3;"></canvas>

	
     	<script>

		var canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
		var ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");

		function draw() {
    			ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
		}

		setInterval(draw, 10);

        </script>
